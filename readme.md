## Thoughts

This was a really interesting project for me. I use kanban boards all the time for both professional and personal tasks. I think they can be incredibly useful. I get a lot of Trello vibes from this project, but I think there are so many things missing right now.

After finishing the project for the course, I see many ways in which this can improve. Some of the things I would like to add are but not limited to:

- Fixing the highlighting
- Making it easier to drag vs edit
- Adding a delete button to the items
- Add ability to rename columns
- Add ability to add more columns
